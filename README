Parallel Port Pin driver for Linux 2.6: ppin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This kernel module will register the /dev/ppin (10, 151) device which
controls up to eight pins through the first parallel port.

Please note that documentation is mostly lacking at the moment.
Use the source, luke!

Controlling the pins is as easy as echo num state >/dev/ppin, where num
is 0 to 7 and state is one of "on" or "off".
For example "echo 3 on >/dev/ppin" switches the 3rd pin on.

You can read the status of the pins with "cat /dev/ppin".
